# Vault

Vault is a system that allows a group of people to store and access items in a secure fashion on your Drupal site.
Data that is pushed to the server is encrypted with a shared key and is decrypted on the fly when you "open" a vault.
This provides a small a window of opportunity as possible for someone to break into your server and steal vault credentials.

Vault is a work in progress.  Currently it can only encrypt text data, but the hope is that it will be able to encrypt
a wide variety of data types in the future.
